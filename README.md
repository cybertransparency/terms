# [organization] Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

[organization] welcomes feedback from security researchers to help improve our security. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in any of our assets, we want to hear from you. This policy outlines steps for disclosing vulnerabilities to us, what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you.
  
## Scope

This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or maintained by [organization], including public facing websites.

## Guidelines

In participating in our VDP, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other relevant terms, the terms of this policy will prevail.
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly.
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience.
- Use only the Official Channels (listed below) to discuss vulnerability information with us.
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until either they are fixed or at least 90 days have passed.
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems listed above.
- To the furthest extent possible, only interact with test accounts you own or accounts with explicit permission from the account owner.
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data, do not access data beyond the minimum extent necessary to effectively demonstrate the presence of a vulnerability. If you encounter any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information while testing, we ask that you cease testing and submit a report immediately.

## Reporting

In order to submit a vulnerability report, please email security@organization.com with all relevant information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to triage and fix the issue.

## Our Commitment

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Acknowledge reports within 3 business days
- Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is processed
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner
- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy

## Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please contact us at security@organization.com before going any further.
